# 🌌 Hubscape Agent Development Shell

Welcome to the official **Hubscape Agent Development Template**. This repository serves as a lightweight, sandboxed environment for designing, testing, and developing custom agents for the Hubscape platform using skeleton templates.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started (Zero-Config Connection)

### 1. Install the Hubscape ADK CLI
Make sure you have Python 3.10+ and `pipx` installed. If you do not have `pipx`, install it and configure your global path:
*   **macOS (Homebrew):** `brew install pipx && pipx ensurepath`
*   **Linux (APT):** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install pipx && pipx ensurepath`
*   **Windows:** `python -m pip install --user pipx && python -m pipx ensurepath`

*(Note: If you just installed `pipx`, close and restart your terminal to apply the path changes).*

Once `pipx` is ready, run the installation command:
```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/Zco-AI-Labs/Hubscape-ADK-Studio.git
```
*(This command installs the global `hubscape-adk` CLI runner, along with the Holodeck frontend and database gateway dependencies).*

### 2. Bootstrap / Clone the Agent Repository
To clone this template repository directly into your active IDE workspace directory (or any empty folder), open your terminal and run:
```bash
hubscape-adk clone https://github.com/Zco-AI-Labs/your-agent-repo
```
*(If your active folder already contains editor workspaces or config files, the smart CLI will warn you and prompt for confirmation before executing a safe merge).*

### 3. Get Credentials
Request a **Developer Personal Access Token (PAT)**, an **Agent UUID**, and a **Deployment Token** from your Hubscape Org Administrator.

### 4. Launch & Connect
From the root of your cloned repository, execute the runner command:
```bash
hubscape-adk
```
The Holodeck console will automatically open in your default browser at **http://localhost:8090**. 

Because this is a fresh template, the **Setup Wizard** will appear:
*   **To Connect Live:** Paste your **Agent UUID** and **Developer PAT**, and click **Connect**. The sandbox will automatically configure your `.env` on disk and establish the live transceiver database link.
*   **To Develop Locally:** Click **Skip to Local Sandbox** to dismiss the wizard and prototype using local mock data.

> [!TIP]
> **Simulating Conversational Routing (Google Gemini API Key):**
> Local testing lets you talk to your agent through a simulated platform **Host AI** that dynamically routes query intents. To enable this conversational routing simulation locally:
> 1. Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
> 2. Paste the key directly in the **Holodeck Settings** panel in your browser, or add it to `.env` in the root of your agent folder as `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here`.
> This enables the sandbox host to organically route user queries to your agent.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The Hubscape ingestion pipeline enforces the **Pure Agent Principle**, copying only the core files and ignoring all local database or environment configs. Organize your code using the structure below:

*   **`app/`**: Contains the core agent application, including the main entry point `agent.py`, instructions in `SKILL.md`, custom tool scripts, and UI widgets.

---

## 💡 Reference Implementations (Blueprints)

To keep this template clean and production-ready, it is configured with barebones skeleton files by default. If you are looking for a complete, functional reference agent to learn from, you can check out:

*   **Todo List Agent:** [hubscape-todo-agent](https://github.com/Zco-AI-Labs/hubscape-todo-agent) — Demonstrates tools, database scopes, permissions, custom API endpoints, and generative dynamic UI rendering.

To test a blueprint, simply clone its repository and run `hubscape-adk` inside its root folder.

## 🛠️ Advanced / Manual Configuration (Optional)

If you prefer to configure your workspace manually before booting the sandbox:
1.  Copy the environment template:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Open `.env` and configure your settings:
    ```env
    HUBSCAPE_DEV_GATEWAY=true
    HUBSCAPE_DEV_PAT=your_developer_token_here
    ```

## 🤖 AI Assistant Support

If you open this repository using an AI-assisted IDE (like Cursor or VSCode with Gemini), the editor will automatically detect the custom rules and templates in the `.agent/` folder:
*   **ADK Expert**: Guides the AI to write correct tool schemas, layout widgets, and Python handlers.
*   **Agent Plan Creator**: Automatically structures your development checklist.
